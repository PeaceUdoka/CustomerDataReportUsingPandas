# Customer Data Analysis Using Pandas

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the data of customers in five different cities in India - Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. 
Cleaning involved removing unnecessary columns and changing datatypes.

## Investigation Overview
The analysis is targeted at answering the following questions

- How does a customer's spending habit vary by age, gender, and annual income?
- How does a customer's credit score vary by age, gender, and annual income?
- What kind of customers should be targeted through marketing strategies to improve sales?

## Summary of Findings
1. There is a greater percentage of females(56%) that are customers than males(44%). 
2. Bengaluru has the highest number of recorded customers.
3. Majority of customers are in the range of 45 - 66.
4. Females spend more than males as they tend to go shopping more than males and they have higher annual incomes on average.

## Recommendations
1. The females should be targeted the most in all cities to improve sales since they earn more and spend more than the average nmale.
2. The cities, Bengaluru and Chennai have the highest number of recorded customers but the lowest average SpendingScore, hence, marketing strategies should be put in place to improve sales in these regions.
